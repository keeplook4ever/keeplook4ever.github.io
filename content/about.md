## 🌿 About Me / 关于我  

I’m a security engineer with eight years of experience —  
a technologist by profession, but also a seeker of meaning beyond code.

Technology, music, literature, film, history, and sports
are how I explore the world and understand myself.

Here, I share thoughts on security and technology,
as well as reflections on the beauty and complexity of life —
a melody, a marathon, a film, or an honest conversation.

Welcome to my space.
May we all find the work we love,
and keep our curiosity alive as we journey into the unknown.

我是一名有八年安全工程经验的科技工作者，
习惯在逻辑与系统中思考，也热爱在生活与人文中感受。

科技、运动、音乐、电影、历史与文学——这些是我探索世界的方式。

在这里，我记录安全与技术的洞见，也记录那些让我心动的瞬间：
一段旋律、一场马拉松、一部电影或一次真诚的交流。

欢迎来到我的世界，愿我们都能找到自己热爱的事业，
并在通往未知的路上，保持好奇与勇气。
